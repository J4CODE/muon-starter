# Muon Starter

This environment provides some base functionality to ease Muon development.

* RabbitMQ - For event distribution
* Photon - for event persistence
* MuonJS Gateway - A muon message router and websocket server that allows muon clients to run in browser.

## Prerequisites

You need to following installed :-
* Make
* Docker
* Docker Compose

If you would like to use the Muon CLI, you need to have Node/ NPM installed.

First, install the latest NPM from https://www.npmjs.com/

Then install the muon CLI and set the MUON_URL env variable to point at the RabbitMQ server running in one of the containers that form the starter.
```
npm install -g muon-cli
export MUON_URL=amqp://muon:microservices@localhost

muon discover
```

Type `muon` to get a list of commands. Follow the http://muoncore.io/guide/index.html[guides] to see what to do next

## Getting Started

Start the environment using docker compose, via Make

```
make
```

The appropriate networks will be created, and docker compose used to start the environment up.

Once the application has started, you can begin interacting with the existing service, adding more services. See the intro
workshop for an introduction - https://github.com/muoncore/muon-workshop
