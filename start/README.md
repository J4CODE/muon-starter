# Muon Starter

This environment provides some base functionality to ease Muon development.

* RabbitMQ - For event distribution
* Docker Infrastructure Link - Provides the capability to stop/ start environments, like this one.

This environment will already be running on the developer VM. You can then stop and start other environments that enable you to investigate
Muon, Photon and other MicroUX projects.
